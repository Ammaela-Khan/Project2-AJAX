My Reflection

This project was definetly difficult because we were given the basic structure of the code with the search bar and we had to add the complex 
features on our own. I learned to fetch and apply API's which was honestly quite interesting all the data being added to the website without
having to add it manually. So I am happy I was able to style the website a little and add the forecast for 5 days and that is exactly what 
this application does. It gives you the weather for any city you like and not just the weather for the day, but also the forecast for the next 5 days.
