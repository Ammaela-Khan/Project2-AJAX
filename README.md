My Reflection

This project was definitely challenging because we were given only the basic structure with the search bar, and we had to build the more complex features ourselves. I learned how to fetch and apply APIs, which was really interesting because all the data appears on the website without being added manually. I’m happy that I was able to style the site and successfully implement the 5-day forecast.

This application now shows the weather for any city you search, including both today’s conditions and the upcoming 5-day forecast.
